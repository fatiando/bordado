    Parameters
    ----------
    coordinates : tuple = (easting, northing, ...)
        Tuple of arrays with the coordinates of each point. Arrays can be
        Python lists or any numpy-compatible array type. Arrays can be of any

    Returns
    -------
    coordinates : tuple = (easting, northing, ...)
        Tuple of coordinate arrays, converted to numpy arrays if necessary.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
